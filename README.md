Using an API for the first time to pull data from an external source to display a 5 day forecast for any city in the US.  Of course the only two in my example are Oakland because I have a cousin there and Salt Lake City.

## Installation

-Once the repository is downloaded all you need to do is open the index.html file in your browser and you can search the weather to your hearts content.

## Usage

This will of course be helpful for anyone who travels or enjoys outdoor activities so that if you don't have access to the weather at the time you can just punch in anywhere you want and get the current weather and the upcoming 5 day forecast.

Going back to fix this was actually a lot easier at the end of the course after everything we have learned.  It was almost funny to see an application that was so simple.
